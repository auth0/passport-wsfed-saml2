Security vulnerability details for passport-wsfed-saml2 < 3.0.10
===============================================================

A vulnerability was found in the validation of a SAML signature. The validation doesn't ensure that the "Signature" tag is at the proper location inside an "Assertion" tag. This leads to a signature relocation attack where the attacker can corrupt one field of data while
maintaining the signature valid. This could allow an authenticated attacker to "remove" one group from his assertion or corrupt another field of an assertion.
